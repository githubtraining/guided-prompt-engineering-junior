- Check them off each day
- See how well you're doing over time

## What You'll Learn üß†

- How to make a webpage with HTML
- How to make it look cool with CSS
- How to make it actually DO stuff with Python and JavaScript

## Need Help? üÜò

Just ask your instructor or friends if you get stuck! Everyone needs help sometimes!

Happy coding! You got this! üëç

## Getting Started üòé

1. Log into your GitHub user account (or create one if you don't have any)
2. Click the green **Use this template** button at the top of this page
3. Give your repository a cool name (like "my-awesome-habit-tracker")

> Wait for a minute to copy the files over and page to load

3. Click the green **Code** button, then select the **Codespaces** tab
4. Click **Create codespace on main** to start your coding workspace
5. Wait a minute while your coding space loads (it's like loading a video game!)
6. Once it's ready, you'll see your project files on the left side
7. Open **GitHub Copilot Chat**, and say *"Hello"*

> Wait for GitHub Copilot Chat to load and reply back to you

8. Select **Agent** mode and **Claude Sonnet 3.5** model, and start chatting with the following prompts!

## Guided Prompt Engineering ‚öôÔ∏è

Hey there! Here's what to do with these prompts:

1. Copy each prompt one at a time
2. Paste it into the **GitHub Copilot Chat** window
3. Wait for Copilot to give you a response (this might take a few seconds)
4. Follow Copilot's instructions to build your app step by step
5. If you get stuck, ask your instructor for help!

Try these prompts in order - each one builds on the one before:

#### üó®Ô∏è Prompt 1

A Habit Tracker that helps people build good habits and track progress. The important things it must include:

- Daily Affirmations: Show positive and motivational messages every day, even offline.

- Habit Tracker: People can add, edit, and delete habits, daily check-in, and have a badge to show the streaks.

- Goal Setting & Progress: People can set streak goal for each habit to stay motivated.

Since I am using GitHub Codespaces, don't need to create a new workspace, use this existing one.
